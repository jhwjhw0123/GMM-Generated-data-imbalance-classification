# GMM-Generated-data-imbalance-classification
This is a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM)-generated dataset to be used in label-imbalanced classification. The data was generated by SK-learn *make-classification* function, and the imbalanced ratio is is 1:79, with 7900 samples labeled as ’0’ and 100 marked as ’1’. <br />
Both the majority and minority data come from 10 Gaussian centroids, and there're some noise features to 'trick' the classification algorithm. The fact that the sparse training examples (100) come from 10 clusters makes the classification task a tricky one. Specifically, many algorithms in their vanilla forms, which perform well in label-balanced scenarios, fail miserably for this specific dataset. One can refer to paper *Adaptive Ensemble of Classifiers with Regularization for
Imbalanced Data Classification* for a detailed study. <br />
